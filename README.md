# A Website for Recording all the Images of Bugs I have Accumulated

bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

`bundle update github-pages` if it becomes out of date

### Feature List
- navigation: tab for each insect order plus maybe seperators for other categories (spiders, centipeds, etc.)
- organize entries by date? (search by date probably requires a non static site)
