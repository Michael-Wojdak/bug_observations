# Shield & Assassin Bugs

Shield bugs and assassin bugs are two members of the group heteroptera which translates to "different wing". Most heteropterans have part of their outer wings hardened while the rest is membranous.


### *Emesaya brevipennis*
While this insect closely resembles a stick insect, it is actually a member of the assassin bug family.
It possesses raptorial forelegs similar to those found on praying mantids. Reportedly, these insects prey 
on spiders ["^"](https://web.archive.org/web/20100625114935/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/OAS/oas_pdf/v43/p88_90.pdf).

### Harlequin Bug
*Murgantia histrionica*

This colorful bug is a common pest of plants in the Brassicaceae family including cabbage, kale, broccoli, mustard, etc.
They store chemicals from the plants they feed on to defend themselves from predators. Seen here feeding on a kale plant.
