# Dragonflies and Damselflies

Dragonflies (Anisoptera) and Damsel-Dragonflies (Epiophlebioptera) make up the suborder Epiprocta, while Damselflies form the suborder Zygoptera. Dragonflies are usually larger and hold their wings flat while damselflies tend to hold their wings folded upwards. Both are arial predators and begin their lives as predatory aquatic larvae in freshwater habitats.
