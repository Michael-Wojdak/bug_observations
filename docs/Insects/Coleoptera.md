### Horned Passalus Beetle
*Odontotaenius disjunctus*

a.k.a. the patent-leather beetle. Generally found in rotting logs, they feed on decaying wood. Like some other beetles, the passalus beetle is able to produce a scratching/squeaking sound by rubbing their wings on their body. This is called stridulation. It can be heard when the beetles are disturbed, but is also used as a method of communication between members of a colony.
