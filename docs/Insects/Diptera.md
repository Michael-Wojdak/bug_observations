This fly mimics the appearance and behavior of spider wasps with quick movements. The larvae feed on beetle larvae.

### Golden-backed Snipe Fly
*Chrysopilus thoracicus*

Surprisingly little seems to be known about these flies. Other snipe flies are known to be predatory, but this hasn't seem to have been proven with the golden-backed snipe fly which is sometimes seen visiting flowers. I have only ever encountered them near wetlands or small creeks.
