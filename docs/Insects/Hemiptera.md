# True Bugs

### *Emesaya brevipennis*
No common name

While this insect closely resembles a stick insect, it is actually a member of the assassin bug family.
It posseses raptorial forelegs similar to those found on praying mantids. Reportedly, these insects prey 
on spiders ["^"](https://web.archive.org/web/20100625114935/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/OAS/oas_pdf/v43/p88_90.pdf).
This individual was found in the grass along the edge of some woods.
